At trial, the manufacturer has called as an expert witness a product safety engineer, who testifies that the manufacturer retained him for a fee to test identical mowers and, if his opinion was helpful, to testify in the case.  The expert then testifies that he did test the mowers, and that the blade, as designed and installed by the manufacturer, could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff.  Assume that the expert has used a reliable method for reaching his conclusion.","No, because it goes to an ultimate issue that only the jury can decide.","No, because the manufacturer paid the expert to render a certain opinion, in violation of rules barring paid testimony.","Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.","Yes, provided that the plaintiff had notice and an opportunity to participate in the testing process.",C,,,
Should the expert’s opinion be admitted?,"At a defendant’s trial for drug dealing, a prosecution witness testified that he had heard the defendant telling a group of people to come to the defendant’s house because he had “a great crop of apples for sale.”  The prosecutor then called and qualified a drug enforcement agent as an expert in how drug dealing is conducted.  The prosecutor now seeks to have the expert testify that in her opinion, based on years of experience with drug dealers, the defendant’s statement about the apples was code for his having drugs for sale.","No, because an expert must base his or her opinion on scientific or technical data, not merely on experience.","No, because the opinion is based on the criminal actions of others engaged in drug dealing, and thus is substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.","Yes, because the opinion is based on her specialized knowledge, and it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence and determining facts in issue in the case.","Yes, provided that the expert first testifies about the specific information upon which she based her view that the defendant was using ""apples"" as a code word to refer to drugs.",C,,,

Should the court allow the plaintiff’s expert to testify at trial?,"A plaintiff who lives near a factory has sued the company that owns it, alleging that a toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff to suffer a respiratory disease.  The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease.  The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure.

At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff’s respiratory disease.  The company has objected to the admission of the expert’s testimony.

At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert’s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff’s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue.  These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from.  On cross-examination, the company’s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.","No, because the expert is relying on studies that she read for purposes of preparing her testimony in this litigation.","No, because the plaintiff has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the expert based her opinion on sufficient facts and data and that she employed a reliable methodology.","Yes, because the company has not met its burden of showing that the expert’s opinion is unreliable.","Yes, because the sufficiency of an expert’s basis for an opinion and the reliability of an expert’s methodology are questions of weight for the jury.",B,,,

If sufficient contrary evidence is produced, the presumption no longer has preclusive effect, and the burden of persuasion remains on the party who had it originally. Here, the husband testified that his wife disappeared seven years ago and he has not heard from her since. This created a rebuttable presumption that she was dead. However, the insurer ""burst the bubble"" of this presumption by introducing a note allegedly in the wife's handwriting received five years ago by her son. As a result, the rebuttable presumption no longer has preclusive effect. And the burden of persuasion remains with the husband, who had it originally.

Can the appellate court decide the merits of this claim of error?,"Prior to trial, a defendant charged with a federal crime filed a motion to prevent the prosecution from introducing a confession made by the defendant to the arresting police officer. At the pretrial hearing on the motion, the defendant's lawyer contended that the defendant's confession was not voluntarily made and should be excluded from evidence. The trial court definitively ruled on the record that the confession could be admitted into evidence. At the jury trial, the prosecution called the arresting officer to testify about the defendant's confession. The defendant's lawyer did not object to the introduction of the confession into evidence. The jury ultimately found the defendant guilty. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting his confession into evidence.","No, because the admissibility of evidence is properly a question for a trial court.","No, because the defendant failed to object at trial when the prosecution introduced the confession.","Yes, because an objection was unnecessary under the plain-error rule.","Yes, because the trial court made a definitive ruling on the record admitting the statements.",D,"A party must take steps to preserve the right to challenge the admission or exclusion of evidence on appeal through a process called ""preservation of error."" A party who wishes to claim error regarding the admission of evidence must take the following actions on the record: timely object or move to strike and unless apparent from the context, state the specific ground for the objection or motion to strike. A party need not renew an objection or motion to preserve a claim of error for appeal once the court rules definitively on the record. Here, the defendant's attorney filed a motion prior to trial (i.e., timely objected) to prevent the introduction into evidence of the defendant's confession to the arresting officer. The attorney specifically stated that the confession was not voluntarily made and should be excluded. The trial court then definitively ruled on the record that the confession could be admitted. As a result, the defendant was not required to object at trial when the prosecution introduced the confession. Therefore, an appellate court can decide the merits of this claim of error. Although a trial court determines the admissibility of evidence, a party may challenge the trial court's evidentiary ruling on appeal. Under the plain-error doctrine, a defendant who failed to preserve a claim of error is entitled to appellate relief when a trial court commits an obvious legal error that impacts the defendant's substantial rights.

Here, the judge held a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether evidence was protected by the attorney-client privilege. In making her ruling, the judge considered additional evidence that was protected by the privilege for marital communications. Although the judge is not bound by most of the FRE in such a hearing, she is bound by the rules governing privileged evidence. And since the judge considered privileged evidence in making her ruling, she acted improperly. Matters of law—e.g., whether evidence is admissible—are decided by the judge.

Has the judge violated the applicable Federal Rules of Evidence?,"A criminal defendant in a federal court files a pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized by police. The motion alleges that the seizure violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. At the hearing on the motion, the judge permits two statements over the defendant's objection. The first is testimony by a police officer about an out-of-court statement made by a third party that constitutes hearsay not subject to any hearsay exception; the second is testimony by the defendant's ex-spouse about a privileged conversation she had with the defendant while they were married.

A court may therefore consider otherwise inadmissible hearsay (e.g., the police officer's statement) when determining whether evidence is admissible. Accordingly, the judge did not violate the applicable FRE in permitting the police officer's testimony. However, the court must adhere to the FRE concerning privileges, including the marital-communications privilege. Since the second statement is testimony by the defendant's ex-spouse about a privileged conversation she had with the defendant while they were married, the FRE apply. Therefore, the judge violated the applicable FRE in permitting the testimony of the defendant's ex-spouse.",Themis UWorld,
Has the court correctly applied the burden of persuasion in determining the admissibility of the agent's testimony?,"A defendant is charged with and prosecuted for leaving the scene of an accident. At trial, a state investigative agent, who was properly qualified as an expert witness by the prosecution, testifies that tire tracks found at the scene of the accident matched the make and model of the defendant's vehicle. On cross-examination, the agent admits that there are hundreds of such vehicles in the state. The defendant moves, over the prosecution's objection, to strike the agent's testimony as irrelevant. The judge denies the motion because the defendant has failed to persuade the court that the testimony is irrelevant by a preponderance of the evidence.","No, because, in a criminal case, the prosecution bears the burden of persuasion that evidence is admissible beyond a reasonable doubt.","No, because the prosecution, as the proponent of the agent's testimony, bears the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.","Yes, because the evidence is presumed relevant unless the party challenging its admissibility can establish its irrelevance by a preponderance of the evidence.","Yes, because the party challenging the admissibility of evidence on any ground must establish that ground by a preponderance of the evidence.",B,"Preliminary questions regarding the admissibility of evidence, including whether it is relevant, must be decided by the court. And the party offering the evidence (i.e., the proponent) ordinarily bears the burden to persuade the trial judge of its admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence. Here, the prosecution is the proponent of the state investigative agent's testimony since it qualified the agent to testify as an expert witness. As a result, the prosecution bears the burden of persuading the court of the testimony's relevance by a preponderance of the evidence. And since the judge placed this burden on the defendant when deciding his motion to strike the agent's testimony, the court incorrectly applied the burden of persuasion. In a criminal case, the prosecution bears the burden of persuading the trier of fact of each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the prosecution need only prove that evidence is admissible by a preponderance of the evidence. Relevant evidence is presumed to be admissible unless excluded for some specific reason. But there is no presumption that evidence introduced by a party is relevant. The burden of persuasion rests with the party offering the evidence—not the party challenging the evidence's admissibility

When the owner demanded the money, the customer claimed that he did some research and discovered that the rug was a worthless, synthetic knockoff. The owner has now filed an action against the customer to collect $4,000 in damages for the ruined rug.

The fact that the customer made the offer before learning the value of the rug is irrelevant. What matters is that the customer made the offer to avoid litigation, which makes it inadmissible to prove the amount in dispute.

Should the court sustain the manufacturer's objection?,"A rancher sued the manufacturer of a computer chip that had been implanted in the rancher's cattle for the purpose of identifying and locating the cattle. The complaint alleged that a design defect in the chip prevented the rancher from locating several of his steers during inclement weather, resulting in their deaths. Before trial, a representative of the manufacturer offered to settle the case for a specific sum. During settlement negotiations with the rancher, the representative admitted that the chip had a design defect. The rancher rejected the settlement offer. At trial, the rancher called an expert witness to testify, honestly and in good faith, that the expert's independent inspection of the chip revealed that it had a design defect. The manufacturer objected on the ground that statements made during compromise negotiations are not admissible.
","No, because the evidence regarding the design defect comes from an independent source.","No, because the rancher rejected the manufacturer's settlement offer.","Yes, because the manufacturer revealed the design defect during the settlement negotiations.","Yes, because the rancher seeks to admit testimony about the design defect to prove the validity of his claim.",A,"To encourage the settlement of disputes, FRE 408 bars the admission of evidence of compromise offers, as well as conduct or statements made during compromise negotiations, when that evidence is offered to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or contradiction. However, a party cannot immunize evidence from admission merely by discussing or revealing it during compromise negotiations. That is because matters discussed during compromise negotiations may still be admitted through independent sources. Here, the manufacturer's representative admitted that the computer chip was defectively designed during settlement negotiations. But the rancher is not offering that admission as evidence of the chip's defective design. Instead, the rancher called an expert witness to testify about the design defect discovered during the expert's independent inspection of the chip. And since the evidence regarding the design defect comes from an independent source, the court should not sustain the manufacturer's objection to the expert's testimony.

How should the court rule on the objection by the surgeon's attorney?,"A former patient filed a medical malpractice action against a plastic surgeon after the surgeon improperly reconstructed the patient's nose during a rhinoplasty. The patient claimed that the surgeon breached her duty of care to the patient because she was intoxicated during the surgery. At trial, the surgeon testified during direct examination that she had not consumed any alcohol on the day of the surgery and that she had been sober for the past five years. The patient's attorney subsequently called a bartender to testify that shortly before the surgery, he served the surgeon four glasses of wine. The surgeon's attorney objected to the bartender's testimony.","Overrule the objection, because the bartender's testimony contradicts the surgeon's testimony.","Overrule the objection, because the bartender's testimony demonstrates the surgeon's character for untruthfulness.","Sustain the objection, because evidence of the surgeon's drinking does not pertain to her character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.","Sustain the objection, because the bartender's testimony concerns a collateral matter.",A,"A witness may be impeached by calling into question his/her credibility. One way to impeach a witness is to introduce evidence that directly contradicts the witness's testimony on a material issue in the case. Such evidence can be introduced through the witness's own testimony (i.e., intrinsically) or through another witness's testimony or other sources (i.e., extrinsically). Here, the surgeon testified on direct examination that she did not drink alcohol on the day of the patient's surgery and that she had been sober for five years. However, the bartender's testimony that he served the surgeon four glasses of wine shortly before the surgery directly contradicts the surgeon's testimony. And a material issue in the case is whether the surgeon was intoxicated at the time of the surgery. Therefore, the court should overrule the objection and allow the bartender's testimony because it contradicts the surgeon's testimony. A witness's character for truthfulness may be attacked by reputation or opinion testimony, while specific instances of conduct are generally admissible only during cross-examination. However, the bartender is not testifying as a character witness to the surgeon's untruthfulness but is instead directly contradicting the surgeon's testimony as to a material issue. Generally, a party may not impeach the credibility of a witness by introducing extrinsic evidence about a collateral matter—i.e., a matter that is irrelevant to the outcome of the case. In this case, however, whether the surgeon was intoxicated during the surgery is not a collateral matter but instead a material issue in the case.",Themis UWorld,
Should the court permit the prosecution to ask the psychiatrist this question?,"A psychiatrist was on trial for multiple counts of extortion against her former patients.

At trial, the psychiatrist testified that she adhered to a medical code of ethics and that she would not violate the psychiatrist-patient privilege by revealing a patient's confidential information. On cross-examination, the prosecution intends to ask the psychiatrist whether she cheated on her psychiatry board exam seven years ago. The defense attorney has objected to this question.","No, because the conduct does not directly relate to the subject matter of the psychiatrist's testimony.","No, because the prosecution is asking about a specific instance of conduct.","Yes, because the conduct contradicts the psychiatrist's testimony.","Yes, because the conduct pertains to the psychiatrist's credibility.",D,"A witness may be impeached by calling into question his/her character for truthfulness (i.e., credibility). This is often done through reputation or opinion testimony. A specific instance of conduct, on the other hand, is generally not admissible to attack or support the witness's character for truthfulness. However, the specific instance of conduct may be introduced intrinsically on cross-examination—i.e., the witness may be asked about the conduct—if it is probative of the truthfulness or untruthfulness of the witness. Here, the specific instance of conduct at issue—cheating on a psychiatry board exam—is probative of the psychiatrist's character for truthfulness because cheating inherently involves an act of dishonesty. And the prosecution intends to introduce this conduct intrinsically by asking the psychiatrist about it on cross-examination. Therefore, the court should permit the prosecution to ask the psychiatrist whether she cheated on her psychiatry board exam because the conduct pertains to her credibility as a witness. There is no requirement that a specific instance of conduct relate directly to the subject matter of the witness's current testimony when the witness is being impeached. The conduct need only be probative of the witness's truthfulness or untruthfulness. A witness may be impeached by evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony.

Before the friend could respond, the defendant's attorney objected to the friend being asked about a specific instance of the defendant's conduct.","No, because character evidence is admissible on cross-examination for impeachment purposes.","No, because the defendant opened the door for this unfavorable character evidence by introducing evidence of his own good character.","Yes, because a criminal defendant's character may only be discredited by opinion or reputation evidence.","Yes, because the defendant's firing for theft is not relevant to his character for peacefulness.",D,"Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404, a prosecutor generally may not introduce evidence of a criminal defendant's bad character to show that the defendant acted in conformity with that character on the occasion in question. However, a defendant ""opens the door"" to such evidence by offering evidence of the defendant's own good character for a trait pertinent to the charged crime—in which case the prosecution may offer evidence to rebut it or the defendant's same trait. Here, the defendant called his friend to testify about the defendant's character as a peaceful person (a good character trait pertinent to assault). This opened the door to character evidence to rebut the friend's testimony. But since the prosecutor is asking about character evidence (i.e., the defendant's firing for theft) that is not relevant to the defendant's character for peacefulness, the evidence is inadmissible. Therefore, the court should sustain the defendant's objection. Character evidence is admissible for impeachment purposes to show that a witness is not a person whose testimony should be believed. But here, the prosecutor is asking the friend on cross-examination about a specific instance of the defendant's conduct to discredit the defendant—not impeach the friend (witness).

Can the prosecution introduce this evidence over the lawyer's objection?,A lawyer has been charged with theft for receiving payments from several clients who were billed at the lawyer's hourly rate for services rendered by the lawyer's staff.

This prohibition helps to ensure that the jury convicts the defendant for committing the charged crime—not for having a bad character. However, evidence of a prior crime or wrongful act is admissible for other relevant noncharacter purposes (i.e., MIMIC). For example, a relevant noncharacter purpose includes proving that the perpetrator did not commit a mistake and instead partook in a deliberate act (i.e., absence of mistake). Here, the lawyer claimed that she mistakenly billed her clients. But the prosecution has evidence that the lawyer was previously disciplined for similarly overcharging other clients (i.e., wrongful act). This evidence is inadmissible character evidence if it is used to show that the lawyer had a propensity for dealing dishonestly with her clients. However, evidence of prior wrongful acts refutes the lawyer's assertion that the billing errors were honest mistakes. Therefore, the prosecution may introduce this evidence to show an absence of mistake. Character may generally only be proven by reputation or opinion testimony. But specific acts can always be used for relevant noncharacter purposes—e.g., to prove an absence of mistake (as seen here).",Themis UWorld,

Realizing that his death was imminent, the bystander told one of the paramedics, ""The chemicals in the herbicide made by the company I used to work for are killing farmers. Ban the herbicide immediately."" The bystander then died. The herbicide company was a defendant in a class action suit filed by farmers who used the herbicide. After learning of the bystander's statement to the paramedic, the attorneys for the farmers deposed the paramedic, and the paramedic attested under oath about the bystander's statement. However, before the trial commenced, the paramedic moved to another country and could not be located. At trial, the attorneys for the farmers sought to admit the paramedic's deposition testimony about the bystander's statements. The herbicide company objected on hearsay grounds. The attorneys for the farmers argued that the bystander's statements are admissible as a dying declaration and that the paramedic's deposition testimony falls under the former testimony exception to hearsay.","Overrule the objection, because the bystander believed his death was imminent.","Overrule the objection, because the herbicide company had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the paramedic's testimony.","Sustain the objection, because the bystander's statement was unrelated to his cause of death.","Sustain the objection, because the paramedic is unavailable to testify.",C,"The rule against hearsay bars the admission of an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein. When such a statement is contained within another (i.e., hearsay within hearsay), neither statement is admissible unless both are excluded or excepted from the rule against hearsay. Under the former testimony exception, the testimony of an unavailable declarant is admissible if the testimony was given at a trial, hearing, or deposition in the current case or in a different proceeding involving similar parties and issues and the party against whom the testimony is offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop that testimony through direct or cross-examination. In this case, the paramedic is unavailable to testify as a witness because he has left the country and cannot be located. The paramedic gave testimony at a deposition in the current case, and the herbicide company—the party against whom the testimony is offered—had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the paramedic's testimony. Thus, the paramedic's deposition testimony falls within the former testimony exception. But it is only admissible if the bystander's statement is also excluded or excepted from hearsay. A hearsay exception applies to a dying declaration—i.e., a statement made under the belief of impending death that relates to the cause or circumstances of the declarant's impending death. Here, the bystander believed his death was imminent after he was shot in the chest. However, the bystander's statement concerned the herbicide company's use of chemicals that he alleged were killing farmers—not the cause of his death.

However, a statement contained in a police report is inadmissible when it was made to the police officer by someone who was not acting on behalf of the police in making the statement. Here, the neighbor's statement was recorded in the animal control officer's police report, so both the report and the statement in the report must fall within a hearsay exception or exclusion. The report is a record of the officer's investigation of a reported dog bite shortly after the incident based on information supplied by an eyewitness. Therefore, the report itself qualifies as a record of regularly conducted activity.

When the officer led the dog around the vehicle, the dog immediately barked twice after sniffing the trunk. The officer opened the trunk and found cocaine hidden in the sides of the trunk. The driver of the vehicle was arrested and charged with illegal possession of narcotics.

At the driver's trial, the prosecution seeks to have the officer testify that the dog sniffed the trunk and barked twice. The driver's attorney objected that the barks are inadmissible hearsay.","No, because the barks do not constitute hearsay.","No, because the officer found cocaine in the trunk.","Yes, because the barks are being used to prove that there was cocaine in the trunk.","Yes, because the barks constituted an out-of-court assertion.",A,"The rule against hearsay generally prohibits the admission at trial of out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein.

Here, the prosecution seeks to introduce the officer's testimony describing how the dog barked when the dog sniffed the trunk of the driver's vehicle. The dog's barks constituted assertive conduct and are being used to prove that there was cocaine in the trunk (truth of the matter asserted). However, this assertion was made by an animal—not a person—so the dog's barks do not constitute hearsay. Therefore, the driver's attorney is incorrect.

Leading questions are generally permitted on cross-examination but not direct examination. However, leading questions are permitted on direct examination in certain situations. One situation arises when a party calls a witness who is likely to be antagonistic—e.g., an adverse party, a person associated with an adverse party, or a witness who presents adverse testimony. Here, the defendant's boyfriend was antagonistic to the prosecution because he was associated with the defendant. Therefore, the prosecution was permitted to ask him a leading question. This means that the judge likely erred when she sustained the defendant's objection.

However, this is permitted when the witness's memory seems exhausted and the witness can no longer recollect. In this instance, the party may refresh the witness's memory by allowing the witness to examine an item (e.g., a written report—as seen here). If the item helps the witness remember, then the witness may testify from his/her refreshed recollection—but not on the item itself (e.g., the witness cannot read from the refreshing document). Here, the assistant was unable to remember specific details about the victims' tax refunds. As a result, the prosecutor showed the assistant a written report to refresh his memory and ""lead the witness."" Since the assistant stated that the report refreshed his recollection and he could testify without reading from the report, the prosecutor could then resume questioning the assistant about the victims' tax refunds. Therefore, the court will likely overrule the objection. There is no requirement that an item used to refresh a witness's memory be entered into evidence. However, the adverse party is entitled to have the item produced, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about it, and to introduce any relevant portion into evidence.

Under the majority view, either spouse may assert the privilege by refusing to testify or by preventing the other spouse from testifying about the communication at any time—even after divorce or the death of one spouse.

Here, the prosecution seeks to have the chef's ex-husband testify about statements the chef made to him while they were married. Although the ex-husband is willing to testify, his waiver of the marital-communications privilege does not affect the chef's ability to assert this privilege. And since the chef's confidential communication was made while the chef and the ex-husband were still married, the chef can assert the privilege—even after termination of the marriage.

The letter was addressed to the hip-hop artist's attorney and contained detailed information about the manager's concerns about the hip-hop artist's case. The letter also discussed possible strategies the attorney might pursue to defend against the copyright infringement claim.

As soon as the attorney realized her mistake, she contacted the country singer's legal team, asked them to return the letter, and requested that they not use the information contained in the letter during the trial. The attorney also informed the judge assigned to the case of the issue. The country singer's legal team has refused to cooperate and plans to introduce the letter into evidence.","No, because any document sent from a client or a client's representative to an attorney is privileged.","No, because the hip-hop artist's attorney did not waive the attorney-client privilege on behalf of her client.","Yes, because the manager's letter is not covered by the attorney-client privilege.","Yes, because the attorney waived the attorney-client privilege when she gave the letter to the country singer's legal team.",B,"The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a client (or the client's representative) and an attorney made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance. Here, the hip-hop artist's manager (i.e., client's representative) intended the letter to be confidential by addressing it to the artist's attorney. And it was made to obtain legal advice because it discussed the manager's concerns and strategies regarding the case. Therefore, the letter is covered by the attorney-client privilege. Nevertheless, a litigation-related disclosure can serve as a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. In a federal proceeding, a waiver of privilege depends on whether the disclosure was intentional—in which case, the disclosure operates as a waiver of the attorney-client privilege—or unintentional—in which case, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver so long as the privilege holder (1) took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure and (2) promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error. Here, the attorney disclosed the manager's letter to the country singer's legal team, despite taking reasonable steps to protect privileged materials. However, this unintentional disclosure did not operate as a waiver of the attorney-client privilege because she also took reasonable steps to rectify the error by promptly contacting both the country singer's legal team and the judge. Therefore, the judge should not permit the letter to be introduced into evidence. Not all documents exchanged between a client or a client's representative to an attorney are protected by the attorney-client privilege. But such a document would be privileged if it is (1) intended to be confidential and (2) made for the purpose of obtaining legal assistance.",Themis UWorld,
"Assuming the recorded conversation is otherwise admissible, does the existence of the recording of the conversation preclude the speaker from testifying about the conversation?","A speaker sued a company for breach of contract to recover the $25,000 fee specified in the written contract for delivering a talk at a company event. The speaker appeared on the date designated in the written contract but was informed that the event had been moved to the following day. Because of other plans, the speaker was not available on the next day.

The company contended that the speaker had been informed of and agreed to the change in date during a phone call with the company's meeting planner. The speaker, on the other hand, contended that the change agreed to during the phone call was to the time of day she was to speak, not the date.

During discovery, the company learned that the speaker had recorded the conversation on her cell phone and currently had it on her cell phone.","No, because a recording is not subject to the best evidence rule.","No, because the speaker was a party to the conversation and can testify based on her memory of it.","Yes, because the recording constitutes an original recording.","Yes, because the recording constitutes the best evidence of the parties' modified agreement.",B,"The best evidence rule requires that the original document (or a reliable duplicate) be produced to prove the contents of a writing, recording, or photograph, including electronic documents, x-rays, and videos. This rule applies only when the contents of the document are at issue—i.e., when the document is used to prove that an event occurred (e.g., police incident report), the document has a legal effect (e.g., contract, will, power of attorney), or the witness is testifying based on facts learned from the document—not personal knowledge (i.e., knowledge based on firsthand observations or experience). Here, the company's planner and the speaker had a conversation in which the agreement was modified, but there is a dispute as to what was modified—the date or the time. Although the speaker recorded the conversation, the recording was not made to give the recording itself a legal effect. And since the speaker was a party to the conversation and can testify based on her memory of it, the contents of the recording are not at issue. Therefore, the existence of the recording does not preclude the speaker from testifying about the conversation. A recording is subject to the best evidence rule. Therefore, had the contents of the recording been at issue, the speaker would have been required to produce the recording instead of testifying. The recording on the speaker's phone is the original recording of the parties' conversation and would be required to be produced at trial if the contents of the recording were at issue (not seen here). Despite its name, the best evidence rule does not require a party to present the most persuasive evidence, nor does it require the presentation of documentary evidence instead of a witness's testimony simply because a document is available.",Themis UWorld,
Was the judge's ruling proper?,"A businessman is on trial for tax evasion after failing to disclose $250,000 in additional income on his federal income tax return. At trial, the prosecution subpoenaed the businessman's tax advisor to testify. Federal authorities had been investigating the tax advisor for assisting the businessman and other clients to commit tax evasion. In exchange for her testimony at the businessman's trial, the tax advisor was granted immunity.

When the prosecution asked the tax advisor if she had prepared the financial documents for the businessman that intentionally omitted the additional $250,000 in income, the tax advisor stated that she did not remember. After authenticating several business records bearing the tax advisor's signature that omitted the additional $250,000 in income, the tax advisor again stated that she was not 100% sure that she had prepared the financial documents. The businessman's attorney objected to the tax advisor's testimony due to her lack of personal knowledge and moved to strike her testimony and the authenticated business records from the record. The judge overruled the objection, ruling that the business records authenticated by the prosecution showed that the tax advisor possessed sufficient personal knowledge to testify.","No, because the judge cannot determine the credibility of the tax advisor's testimony.","No, because the judge used extrinsic evidence to determine that the tax advisor had sufficient personal knowledge.","Yes, because a reasonable jury could find that the tax advisor possessed sufficient personal knowledge based on the business records authenticated by the prosecution.","Yes, because the judge has the right to determine whether the tax advisor had personal knowledge.",C,"A witness can testify as to any relevant matter of which he/she has personal knowledge. Personal knowledge means that the witness perceived the matter firsthand and has a present recollection of the matter. To determine whether a witness possesses sufficient personal knowledge to testify, the judge must determine whether, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury could find that the witness possesses personal knowledge. This can be established by the witness's own testimony or by extrinsic evidence (e.g., documents). Here, the tax advisor testified at the businessman's trial for tax evasion that she was not 100% sure that she had prepared the financial documents that omitted the additional income. However, the prosecution authenticated several business records signed by the tax advisor that omitted the additional income. Based on those records, a reasonable jury could find that the tax advisor possessed sufficient personal knowledge regarding preparation of the financial documents to testify. Therefore, the judge properly overruled the objection to her testimony. In a jury trial, the judge's role is to determine whether a reasonable jury could find that a witness such as the tax advisor possesses personal knowledge. The jury ultimately determines whether the witness in fact possesses such knowledge. And the jury—not the judge—also determines the credibility of a witness's testimony.",Themis UWorld,
How should the court rule on the objection made by the woman's attorney?,"A woman struck a federal public works employee with her vehicle as the employee was directing traffic near a worksite. The employee suffered multiple back fractures as a result of the woman's actions. The employee sued the woman for negligence in a federal district court under a federal statute.

At trial, the employee's lawyer called the employee's coworker who was present at the scene of the accident to testify about the events. The coworker testified that he was 10 feet away from the accident when it occurred and heard the woman say after the crash that she did not see the employee in the road. The woman's attorney objects that the coworker lacks sufficient personal knowledge to testify as to the woman's statement, which the woman's attorney concedes is admissible nonhearsay as a statement by a party-opponent.","Overrule the objection, because the coworker has personal knowledge as to the making of the statement.","Overrule the objection, because the jury has the responsibility to determine whether the coworker has sufficient personal knowledge to testify as to the woman's statement.","Sustain the objection, because the court cannot determine whether the coworker has sufficient personal knowledge to testify.","Sustain the objection, because the coworker does not have personal knowledge of the matter asserted in the woman's statement.",A,"A lay witness (i.e., any witness other than an expert witness) is competent to testify at trial so long as he/she (1) has personal knowledge of the matter about which he/she is to testify and (2) appreciates the importance of the truth. When a witness is testifying as to hearsay, the witness must have personal knowledge regarding the making of the statement but need not have personal knowledge of the matter asserted therein. Here, the coworker testified that he was 10 feet away from the accident when it occurred and heard the woman say after the crash that she did not see the employee in the road (hearsay). Although the coworker does not have personal knowledge of the matter asserted in the woman's statement, he has personal knowledge as to the making of the statement since he heard the woman say it. Therefore, the court should overrule the objection made by the woman's attorney. As a statement by a party-opponent, the woman's statement is admissible nonhearsay. The jury has the responsibility to weigh a witness's credibility—not determine whether a witness has sufficient personal knowledge to testify. Instead, the court must make this determination.",Themis UWorld,
How is the court likely to rule on the objection?,"A woman was accused of murdering her roommate after the roommate accused the woman of stealing money from the roommate. The roommate's twelve-year-old child witnessed the incident. When law enforcement responded to the scene, the child was in shock. He told law enforcement that he remembered the argument that transpired before the murder but did not remember seeing the woman shoot the roommate.

During the investigation, law enforcement again interviewed the child and used a police hypnotist to elicit information from the child that they believed he was suppressing due to the shock of the event. While under hypnosis, the child was able to recall the events of the shooting and told the police hypnotist that he saw the woman shoot the roommate.

At the woman's criminal trial, the prosecution called the child to testify. After establishing that the child understood the importance of telling the truth, the prosecution asked the child about what he witnessed on the day of the murder. The child testified as to the events that happened before the shooting and then recounted that he identified the woman as the shooter while under hypnosis in the police interview. The woman's attorney objected to the child's testimony on the ground that the child lacked sufficient personal knowledge to be a competent witness.

The applicable jurisdiction's rules of evidence mirror the Federal Rules of Evidence.","Overrule the objection, because being placed under hypnosis did not affect the credibility of the child's testimony.","Overrule the objection, because the child was able to recall and narrate impressions of the occurrence at issue.","Sustain the objection, because the child has not reached the age of majority.","Sustain the objection, because the child's testimony is unreliable.",B,"Under Federal Rule of Evidence 601, a person is generally presumed competent to testify. When a question regarding a witness's competency arises, the court should allow the testimony if the witness has personal knowledge—i.e., is able recall and narrate impressions of the occurrence at issue—and is able to understand the importance of telling the truth—i.e., understands the difference between the truth and a lie and knows the importance of honesty. And any issues raised regarding a witness's mental abilities, including the witness's ability to perceive, recall or recount a matter, affect the witness's credibility—not the witness's competency to testify. Here, the woman's attorney objected to the child's testimony on the ground that he lacked sufficient personal knowledge of the events to be a competent witness since he was under hypnosis when he identified the woman as the shooter. This fact may affect the credibility of the child's testimony. But the child understood the importance of telling the truth and was able to recall and narrate impressions of the occurrence at issue. As a result, the child is a competent witness, and the court will likely overrule the objection by the woman's attorney. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, there is no age of majority that a person must attain to be a competent witness. And since the applicable jurisdiction's rules of evidence mirror the Federal Rules of Evidence, the child need not be a particular age to testify. A judge must determine whether, based on the sufficiency of the evidence, a reasonable jury could find that the witness possesses sufficient personal knowledge. The jury must then determine whether the witness's testimony is credible or unreliable.",Themis UWorld,
Were the judge's actions permissible?,"A drug smuggler was indicted in federal court for distribution of a controlled substance after he was caught with several kilograms of a controlled substance. During a break in the trial of the drug smuggler's case, an impaneled juror showed his fellow jurors a news article from a local website about the drug smuggler's alleged criminal connections. This news article was not introduced as evidence in the trial. The drug smuggler's attorney witnessed the juror showing others this article. When court proceedings resumed, the drug smuggler's attorney moved for a mistrial and called for a hearing in which the attorney seeks to have the juror testify.

Before the hearing on the motion began, the judge dismissed the jury to the deliberation room and the prosecution objected, arguing that the juror was not competent to testify at the hearing. The judge overruled this objection and called the jury back into the courtroom to sit in on the mistrial hearing. The juror was then called to testify about the dissemination of the new article to other jurors.","No, because a juror may never be called as a witness in a trial in which he or she is impaneled.","No, because the juror must testify outside the presence of the other jurors.","Yes, because a juror may testify about matters that occur during trial.","Yes, because the government objected to the juror's testimony outside the presence of the jury.",B,"A juror is generally prohibited from testifying (i.e., not competent to testify) during a trial in which he/she is impaneled as a juror. However, a juror may be called to testify as to matters that occur during trial—e.g., bribery of a juror, use of extraneous prejudicial information not admitted into evidence. If a juror is called to testify during trial, the opposing party must be given an opportunity to object outside the presence of the jury and the juror must testify outside the presence of the other jurors. Here, the drug smuggler's attorney moved for a mistrial after seeing a juror circulate to other jurors an article—not admitted into evidence—that discussed the drug smuggler's alleged criminal connections (extraneous prejudicial information). The attorney seeks to have the juror testify at the hearing on the motion. The prosecution had the opportunity to object outside the jury's presence. But since the juror must testify outside the presence of the other jurors, the judge erred in allowing them at the hearing. Therefore, the judge acted improperly.",Themis UWorld,
Who may testify at the postconviction-relief hearing?,A man was tried and convicted in federal court of murdering a federal law enforcement officer and was subsequently sentenced to death. The man filed a motion for postconviction relief on the grounds of (1) juror misconduct based on a juror showing the other jurors a social media video made by the victim's family asking that the jury convict the man of murder and (2) judicial misconduct in the previous trial proceedings. The man seeks to call one of the jurors and the judge who presided over those proceedings to testify at the hearing on his motion.,Neither the judge nor the juror.,The judge only.,The juror only.,Both the judge and the juror.,D,"A judge is prohibited from testifying in a trial over which he/she is presiding. However, a judge may testify as a witness in another trial, hearing, or posttrial proceeding in the same case.

Likewise, jurors are generally prohibited from testifying after trial about (1) any statement made, or incident that occurred, during jury deliberations, (2) the effect of anything upon that juror or another juror's vote, or (3) any juror's mental process concerning the verdict. However, posttrial juror testimony is admissible if it addresses extraneous prejudicial information brought to the jury's attention, an outside influence improperly brought to bear on a juror, or a mistake made in entering the verdict onto the verdict form. And since the man seeks to call a juror from his murder trial to testify about the circulation of a video made by the victim's family asking the jury to convict the man (extraneous prejudicial information), the juror may do so.",Themis UWorld,
Should the court allow the defense attorney to cross-examine the witness about the psychiatric examination?,"An employee is on trial for murdering his boss six months ago. The prosecution's main witness, who works in the same office building as the employee, testified that two months before the murder, she saw the employee strangle his boss in the stairwell of the building. The defense attorney claims that the witness has a deficiency in her testimonial capacity due to a mental impairment. He seeks to cross-examine the witness about a psychiatric examination that she underwent five years ago when she was a plaintiff in a civil action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The prosecution has objected to this line of questioning.","No, because psychiatric examinations are never admissible for impeachment purposes.","No, because the psychiatric examination does not relate to the witness's ability to testify in this case.","Yes, because a witness may be impeached by offering proof of mental impairment.","Yes, because the psychiatric examination is probative of the witness's testimonial capacity.",B,"A party may impeach (i.e., discredit) a witness by showing a deficiency in his/her testimonial capacities to perceive, recall, or relate information. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the witness is physically or mentally impaired. To do so, a party may impeach the witness through the witness's own testimony, the testimony of another witness, or other extrinsic evidence (e.g., a psychiatric examination). However, the impeachment evidence must be probative of the witness's ability to testify to be admissible. Here, the psychiatric examination was conducted five years ago—long before the witness perceived the altercation between the employee and his boss in the stairwell. In addition, the examination concerned the witness's emotional stress claim, not her ability to perceive and relate information as a witness. Therefore, the psychiatric examination does not relate to the witness's ability to testify in this case, and the court should not allow the defense attorney to cross-examine the witness about it. A witness may be impeached by offering proof of mental impairment. But the evidence must be probative of the witness's ability to testify. Here, the psychiatric examination does not have probative value because it was conducted almost five years prior to the murder and is not related to the witness's ability to testify.",Themis UWorld,
Should the court grant the defense's motion?,"At a trial for attempted theft of an automobile, a witness testified that while walking near her house at the time of the attempted theft, she heard the sound of breaking glass coming from a garage. Evidence that had previously been introduced established the garage as the location from where the automobile in question was stored. The witness then recounted that, several seconds later, she saw a person whom she had never seen before running down the garage driveway past her. She identified the defendant as the person she saw running. No testimony by any other witness established the witness's presence at the scene of the alleged crime.

The defense moved to strike the witness's testimony on the ground that she lacked competency.","No, because the competence of a witness is a matter for the jury to decide.","No, because the witness testified based on her personal knowledge.","Yes, because the witness admitted she had never seen the defendant before this incident.","Yes, because the witness's presence at the scene of the crime had not been established by another witness.",B,"Under Federal Rule of Evidence 602, a lay witness (i.e., non-expert witness) may testify to any relevant matter of which he/she has personal knowledge. This means that the lay witness must have perceived the matter or event firsthand and have a present recollection of that perception. Here, the witness is a lay witness because she has not been qualified as an expert. She testified at trial that she heard glass breaking from a garage and then saw a person she identified as the defendant running down the garage driveway (perception of event). And since she has a present recollection of that perception, she properly testified based on her personal knowledge. As a result, the court should deny the defense's motion to strike her testimony. The competency of a witness is a matter for the court—not the jury—to decide. Instead, it is the jury's role to decide the credibility of a witness. The fact that the witness admitted that she had never seen the defendant before this incident could impact the credibility of her identification of the defendant. But it is not a basis for challenging her competency. Personal knowledge may be established by the witness's own testimony as well as other means. Therefore, it is unnecessary to establish the witness's presence at the scene of the crime through another witness.",Themis UWorld,

Here, the plaintiff's attorney is asking the construction worker (lay witness) to offer his opinion about proximate causation, which is an element of the plaintiff's negligence claim. However, as a nonlawyer, the construction worker likely does not understand the legal principles surrounding this term. And since the construction worker's opinion on this issue would not be helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony, this is the strongest argument that the contractor's attorney can make against permitting the worker to answer the question. A lay opinion cannot be based on specialized knowledge, so the fact that the construction worker does not have any specialized knowledge about excavators is not a strong argument against permitting him to answer the question.
