Should the court admit the expert’s testimony?,"A plaintiff sued the manufacturer of his lawn mower, alleging that, as the result of a design defect, he was injured when the mower’s blade flew off after striking a sprinkler head in the lawn.

At trial, the manufacturer has called as an expert witness a product safety engineer, who testifies that the manufacturer retained him for a fee to test identical mowers and, if his opinion was helpful, to testify in the case.  The expert then testifies that he did test the mowers, and that the blade, as designed and installed by the manufacturer, could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff.  Assume that the expert has used a reliable method for reaching his conclusion.","No, because it goes to an ultimate issue that only the jury can decide.","No, because the manufacturer paid the expert to render a certain opinion, in violation of rules barring paid testimony.","Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.","Yes, provided that the plaintiff had notice and an opportunity to participate in the testing process.",C,,
Should the expert’s opinion be admitted?,"At a defendant’s trial for drug dealing, a prosecution witness testified that he had heard the defendant telling a group of people to come to the defendant’s house because he had “a great crop of apples for sale.”  The prosecutor then called and qualified a drug enforcement agent as an expert in how drug dealing is conducted.  The prosecutor now seeks to have the expert testify that in her opinion, based on years of experience with drug dealers, the defendant’s statement about the apples was code for his having drugs for sale.","No, because an expert must base his or her opinion on scientific or technical data, not merely on experience.","No, because the opinion is based on the criminal actions of others engaged in drug dealing, and thus is substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.","Yes, because the opinion is based on her specialized knowledge, and it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence and determining facts in issue in the case.","Yes, provided that the expert first testifies about the specific information upon which she based her view that the defendant was using ""apples"" as a code word to refer to drugs.",C,,
Should the court allow the defendant’s question?,"A plaintiff, the owner of a condominium building, sued a defendant, a young architect, in federal court.  The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was negligent in designing the plaintiff’s building and that defects in the building’s structural design rendered it unsafe and uninhabitable.  At trial, the plaintiff called a structural engineer as an expert witness and asked her several questions about her education and experience.  The court found that the engineer was qualified to testify as an expert and permitted her to offer an opinion on the soundness of the building’s design.  On cross-examination, the defendant asked the engineer if it was true that she had failed three engineering classes while in graduate school.  The plaintiff has objected to the question.","No, because the court already decided that the engineer is an expert.","No, because the engineer’s character has not been placed in issue.","Yes, because a party may inquire into specific instances of conduct that bear on a witness’s truthfulness during cross-examination.","Yes, because it goes to the weight to be given to the engineer’s testimony.",D,,
Should the court allow the plaintiff’s expert to testify at trial?,"A plaintiff who lives near a factory has sued the company that owns it, alleging that a toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff to suffer a respiratory disease.  The company contends that only a small amount of the toxin was released for a brief period, and that in any event the toxin is not known to cause any respiratory disease.  The plaintiff has not disputed the minimal amount and brief length of the exposure.

At trial, the plaintiff seeks to call an expert who will testify that in her opinion the toxin released from the factory caused the plaintiff’s respiratory disease.  The company has objected to the admission of the expert’s testimony.

At a pretrial hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert’s testimony, the expert testified that she based her opinion on several studies provided by the plaintiff’s attorney about another substance that is similar to the toxin at issue.  These studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of the similar substance can cause the respiratory disease that the plaintiff suffers from.  On cross-examination, the company’s attorney elicits from the expert an admission that she did not consider, in forming her opinion, two recent clinical studies, both of which concluded that there was no connection between the toxin at issue and any respiratory disease.","No, because the expert is relying on studies that she read for purposes of preparing her testimony in this litigation.","No, because the plaintiff has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the expert based her opinion on sufficient facts and data and that she employed a reliable methodology.","Yes, because the company has not met its burden of showing that the expert’s opinion is unreliable.","Yes, because the sufficiency of an expert’s basis for an opinion and the reliability of an expert’s methodology are questions of weight for the jury.",B,,
